      <p>We consulted with Jesse at the initial phase of Camperoo; his expertise on the best way forward enabled us to focus on features our users cared about. Our system is awesome and helps us connect parents and camps in a painless way; it's fast, we love adding features, and we are confident in our architecture. I recommend him for your Rails projects.</p>

      <p>Jesse prototyped the initial Whimseybox subscription application on time and on budget. He was supremely helpful in developing the scope of the project as I had little/no experience with what I was asking to have done. In addition, after the project was complete he continued to provide great support anytime I or my CTO had questions. Jesse is exactly the kind of person I like to work with - super smart, a great communicator and also really friendly. I highly recommend him. </p>
