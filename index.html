    <h3>The Idea Haunts You...</h3>
    <p>People would tell all their friends about it, they would love it so much, if
    it were real, you’re sure of it. The idea haunts you, butting in to your
    thoughts and daydreams, leaving room for little else. The excitement
    flickers in a corner of your mind, begging to be let out. Only, you have a
    career to worry about, and you don’t have the technical chops to create your
    MVP anyway.</p>

    <h3> Your Product: Viable and Valuable</h3>
    <p>What if you had a plethora of feedback from real customers that used and
    loved your product? You could invest more money into the product, disrupting
    competitors and taking market share, point by point. Eventually, you’ll
    pocket money away for more products, as you build an empire of applications
    — your salary becoming optional.</p>

    <h3>From Idea to MVP</h3>
    <p>I’m Jesse Wolgamott, and I create products. I build your idea into a Minimum
    Viable Product — the essence of your idea distilled into a usable and
    testable experiment. You’ll use this initial version of the idea to beta
    test with real users, accepting real money for the product, and have the
    knowledge to decide if your product is ready to go to the next level. More
    importantly, you reduce risk if your research is wrong: early feedback can
    prevent a disaster.</p>

      <p>We consulted with Jesse at the initial phase of Camperoo; his expertise on the best way forward enabled us to focus on features our users cared about. Our system is awesome and helps us connect parents and camps in a painless way; it's fast, we love adding features, and we are confident in our architecture. I recommend him for your Rails projects.</p>

      <p>Jesse prototyped the initial Whimseybox subscription application on time and on budget. He was supremely helpful in developing the scope of the project as I had little/no experience with what I was asking to have done. In addition, after the project was complete he continued to provide great support anytime I or my CTO had questions. Jesse is exactly the kind of person I like to work with - super smart, a great communicator and also really friendly. I highly recommend him. </p>
