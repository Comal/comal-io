    <p>We are experts at bringing web applications back from the brink;
        from apps that never quite fit your needs, to apps that were outsourced
        and have never worked rights, all the way up to apps that are simply outdated.
        <strong>Comal Saves Apps</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Sometimes, an application has to be rewritten; but in most cases we can avoid that pain and suffering.
      <strong>We evaluate your app based on code quality and the ability to improve and maintain it.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>We'll recommend a course of action that protects your business's app in the short term and long term.
      <strong>After we've saved your app, we'll keep it healthy</strong>.
    </p>


    <p>We work with organizations agile enough to still know each other and make a positive impact socially, valuing collaboration, and being invested in maximizing returns on investment.</p>


    <p>
      Who Comal is NOT for: Large companies that dictate terms and don’t collaborate, or Companies looking for the lowest price.

      <p>We consulted with Jesse at the initial phase of Camperoo; his expertise on the best way forward enabled us to focus on features our users cared about. Our system is awesome and helps us connect parents and camps in a painless way; it's fast, we love adding features, and we are confident in our architecture. I recommend him for your Rails projects.</p>

      <p>Jesse prototyped the initial Whimseybox subscription application on time and on budget. He was supremely helpful in developing the scope of the project as I had little/no experience with what I was asking to have done. In addition, after the project was complete he continued to provide great support anytime I or my CTO had questions. Jesse is exactly the kind of person I like to work with - super smart, a great communicator and also really friendly. I highly recommend him. </p>
