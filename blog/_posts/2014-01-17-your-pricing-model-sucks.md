title: Your Pricing Model Sucks For Bootstrappers
subtitle: "Stretch Pricing Goals"

excerpt:
  Instead of requiring the entire development fees before the idea launches, we
  stretch the costs out over a 6-12 month period. What’s great about this, is you
  can keep working at your job to make money while you build your business.

  The salary pays for the initial development, but you still get the MVP in 2
  months.

You're an Entreprenuer. You have an idea, and want to bring it to life. You've
done your research, and have even consulted with your Small Business Council.
And, armed with this information, you even start looking around for a technical
co-founder. This predictably fails, leading you into the arms of an Agency.

The Agency looks at your plans, decides they are great and want to be in
business. Only, it will cost $50,000 - $150,000 to get started. You are woo'ed.
And, you consider cashing in your 401(k) for this idea.

<h3>There is a better way</h3>

Your idea is to bootstrap the product, right? So why would you lay down the
at least the entire cost of development first?

<h3>Introducing Stretch Pricing</h3>

Instead of requiring the entire development fees before the idea launches, we
stretch the costs out over a 6-12 month period. What's great about this, is you
can keep working at your job to make money while you build your business.

The salary pays for the initial development, but <strong>you still get the MVP
in 2 months</strong>.


<h3>Example Numbers</h3>

A MVP for a typical web application normally costs $12,000 $30,000, centering
around either $20,000. 


<strong>Usual Agency Approach - $20,000 MVP</strong>
* May 1: $10,000 Payment
* July 1: $10,000 Payment
* August 1: $3,000 Overages

<strong>Comal Stretch Pricing Model - $20,000 MVP</strong>
* May 1 through April 1: $1,750

But, this is a real thing, and exactly what Bootstrapping Entreprenuers need, 
but rarely get. World class products, creating a tightly crafted and artisan
modeled MVP, with a monthly financing model you can live with.
